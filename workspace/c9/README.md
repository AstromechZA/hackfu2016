2016-01-09  #vendetta   28.73662    29.448267   ?           Others haven't found me, that's sad, you wouldn't think it, with the many clues they had
2016-01-16  #ignite                             ?           Night is approaching and our game has been played, solve it as quick as you can and come to my aid

#exile = 27;
#wicker = -23;
#canine = 28

y = b1*x1 + b2*x2 + c

-27; 25; 27; -23; 28 added -> 30

"forget the month and even the year" is the y value the day?

kinda confused,

- writer = b1x + b2y + c didn't show any common intersections or anything
- day = b1x + b2y + c didn't show any common intersections either

solving series of 3 simultaneous eqs for canine and exile yielded no common values
pretty sure that means that they arent dependent on each other..
