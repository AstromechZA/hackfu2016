## Doc file

opened doc file as bytes

found phrase 'Well Done, the second answer lies within!' -> 'welldonethesecondanswerlieswithin'
found phrase 'youcannotspellscorchedearthwithoutdeath'

but could not decrypt anything with it...

need a word list?

cracked it super quickly with a word list: 'salinas'

which revealed: 'sometimesthepuzzleisitsownreward'

which opens the archive!

looks like there may be another encrypted section inside the doc, saw evidence of it in microsoft word and when I saved it to xml
