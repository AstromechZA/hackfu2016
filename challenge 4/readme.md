# Challenge 4 - Audio

- Given the usual encrypted solution file.
- audio1.wav
- exif.zip

listening to it, it definitely sounds like it has morse code or something but a bit too obfouscated to transcribe by ear.

## Hellschreiber

found reference at the bottom of the file to:
"Rudolf Light Writer"
"Fldigi"

http://hackaday.com/2014/04/15/the-hellzxchreiber/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellschreiber

sounds the same! definitely generated with the same fldigi tool.

1. open wav in VLC
2. Install the hellschreiber Android app 
3. Listen to the wav file
4. Profit! "BRINGLIFETOTHEWASTELAND"
5. This decrypted the zip file and revealed audio2.wav
6. Open audio 2 
7. Reverse, increase speed (Backmasking / Speed in exif tags)
8. Message says: "You have solved the 4th challenge, proceed to Eden to face the 5th challenge"

Very confused, still don't have password that decrypts the encrypted solution
Emailed MWR, they say I have the password, but it's not working?
